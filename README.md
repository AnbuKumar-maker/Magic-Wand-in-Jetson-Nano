# Magic-Wand-in-Jetson-Nano
The wands which are bought from the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal Studios, have a retroreflective bead at their tip. Those retroreflective beads reflect a great amount of infrared light which is given out by the camera in the motion capture system. So, what we humans perceive as a not-so-distinctive tip of the wand moving in the air, the motion capture system perceives as a bright blob which can be easily isolated in the video stream and tracked to recognize the pattern drawn by the person and execute the required action. All this processing takes place in real time and makes use of computer vision and machine learning. A simple night vision camera can be used as our camera for motion capture as they also blast out infrared light which is not visible to humans but can be clearly seen with a camera that has no infrared filter. So, the video stream from the camera is fed into a Raspberry Pi which has a Python program running OpenCV which is used for detecting, isolating and tracking the wand tip. Then we use SVM (Simple Vector Machine) algorithm of machine learning to recognize the pattern drawn and accordingly control the GPIOs of the Jetson Nano to perform some activities. In this case, the GPIOs control a servo motor which opens or closes a harry potter themed box according to the letter drawn by the person with the wand.
